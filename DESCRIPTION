Description: Implements the Vector Matching algorithm to match multiple
    treatment groups based on previously estimated generalized propensity
    scores. The package includes tools for visualizing initial confounder
    imbalances, estimating treatment assignment probabilities using various
    methods, defining the common support region, performing matching across
    multiple groups, and evaluating matching quality. For more details, see 
    Lopez and Gutman (2017) <doi:10.1214/17-STS612>.
