\arguments{
\item{data}{A non-empty \code{data.frame} containing at least one numeric column,
as specified by the \code{y} argument. This argument must be provided and does
not have a default value.}

\item{y}{A single string or unquoted symbol representing the name of a
numeric column in the \code{data}. In the vector matching workflow, it is
typically a numeric covariate that requires balancing.}

\item{group}{A single string or unquoted symbol representing the name of a
factor or character column in \code{data}. In \code{raincloud()} plots, the groups
specified by \code{group} argument will be distinguished by separate \code{fill} and
\code{color} aesthetics. For clarity, it is recommended to plot fewer than 10
groups, though there is no formal limit.}

\item{facet}{A single string or unquoted symbol representing the name of a
variable in \code{data} to facet by. This argument is used in a call to
\code{\link[ggplot2:facet_wrap]{ggplot2::facet_wrap()}}, creating separate distribution plots for each
unique group in the \code{facet} variable.}

\item{ncol}{A single integer. The value should be less than or equal to the
number of unique categories in the \code{facet} variable. This argument is used
only when \code{facet} is not NULL, specifying the number of columns in the
\code{\link[ggplot2:facet_wrap]{ggplot2::facet_wrap()}} call. The distribution plots will be arranged into
the number of columns defined by \code{ncol}.}

\item{significance}{A single string specifying the method for calculating
p-values in multiple comparisons between groups defined by the \code{group}
argument. Significant comparisons are represented by bars connecting the
compared groups on the left side of the boxplots. Note that if there are
many significant tests, the plot size may adjust accordingly. For available
methods refer to the \emph{Details} section. If the \code{significance} argument is
not \code{NULL}, standardized mean differences (SMDs) are also calculated and
displayed on the right side of the jittered point plots.}

\item{sig_label_size}{An integer specifying the size of the significance and
SMD (standardized mean difference) labels displayed on the bars on the
right side of the plot.}

\item{sig_label_color}{Logical flag. If \code{FALSE} (default), significance and
SMD bars and text are displayed in the default color (black). If \code{TRUE},
colors are applied dynamically based on value: nonsignificant tests and SMD
values below 0.10 are displayed in green, while significant tests and SMD
values of 0.10 or higher are displayed in red.}

\item{smd_type}{A single string indicating the type of effect size to
calculate and display on the left side of the jittered point plots:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean} - Cohen's d is calculated,
\item \code{median} - the Wilcoxon effect size (r) is calculated based on the Z
statistic extracted from the Wilcoxon test.
}}

\item{density_scale}{Character(1). Scaling method for the violin density.
\itemize{
\item \code{"area"}: all violins have the same total area (default).
\item \code{"count"}: violin areas are proportional to the number of observations.
\item \code{"width"}: all violins have the same maximum height (width when they are
placed horizontally), regardless of sample size.
}}

\item{limits}{A numeric atomic vector of length two, specifying the \code{y} axis
limits in the distribution plots. The first element sets the minimum value,
and the second sets the maximum. This vector is passed to the
\code{\link[ggplot2:lims]{ggplot2::xlim()}} function to adjust the axis scale.}

\item{jitter}{A single numeric value between 0 and 1 that controls the amount
of jitter applied to points in the \code{\link[ggplot2:geom_jitter]{ggplot2::geom_jitter()}} plots. Higher
values of the \code{jitter} argument produce more jittered plot. It's
recommended to keep this value low, as higher jitter can make the plot
difficult to interpret.}

\item{alpha}{A single numeric value between 0 and 1 that controls the
transparency of the density plots, boxplots, and jittered point plots.
Lower values result in higher transparency. It is recommended to keep this
value relatively high to maintain the interpretability of the plots when
using the \code{group} argument, as excessive transparency may cause overlap
between groups, making it difficult to distinguish them visually.}

\item{plot_name}{A string specifying a valid file name or path for the plot.
If set to \code{NULL}, the plot is displayed to the current graphical device but
not saved locally. If a valid name with \code{.png} or \code{.pdf} extension is
provided, the plot is saved locally. Users can also include a subdirectory
in \code{plot_name}. Ensure the file path follows the correct syntax for your
operating system.}

\item{overwrite}{A logical flag (default \code{FALSE}) that is evaluated only if
the \code{save.name} argument is provided. If \code{TRUE}, the function checks
whether a plot with the same name already exists. If it does, the existing
plot will be overwritten. If \code{FALSE} and a plot with the same name exists,
an error is thrown. If no such plot exists, the plot is saved normally.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the function for calculating
p-values when the \code{significance} argument is specified. For available
functions associated with different \code{significance} methods, please refer to
the \emph{Details} section and consult the documentation for the relevant
functions in the \code{rstatix} package.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the distribution of the \code{y} variable
across the levels of the \code{group} and \code{facet} variables in \code{data}.
}
\description{
The \code{raincloud()} function allows to generate distribution plots
for continuous data in an easy and uncomplicated way. The function is based
on the \code{ggplot2} package, which must already be preinstalled Raincloud
plots consist of three main elements:
\itemize{
\item Distribution plots, specifically  violin plots with the mean values and
standard deviations of respective groups,
\item Jittered point plots depicting the underlying distribution of the data in
the rawest form,
\item Boxplots, summarizing the most important statistics of the underlying
distribution.
}
}
\details{
Available methods for the argument \code{significance} are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"t_test"} - Performs a pairwise comparison using the two-sample t-test,
with the default Holm adjustment for multiple comparisons. This test assumes
normally distributed data and equal variances. The adjustment can be
modified via the \code{p.adjust.method} argument. The test is implemented via
\code{\link[rstatix:t_test]{rstatix::pairwise_t_test()}}
\item \code{"dunn_test"} - Executes Dunn's test for pairwise comparisons following a
Kruskal-Wallis test. It is a non-parametric alternative to the t-test when
assumptions of normality or homogeneity of variances are violated.
Implemented via \code{\link[rstatix:dunn_test]{rstatix::dunn_test()}}.
\item \code{"tukeyHSD_test"} - Uses Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test
for pairwise comparisons between group means. Suitable for comparing all
pairs when the overall ANOVA is significant. The method assumes equal
variance between groups and is implemented via \code{\link[rstatix:tukey_hsd]{rstatix::tukey_hsd()}}.
\item \code{"games_howell_test"} - A post-hoc test used after ANOVA, which does not
assume equal variances or equal sample sizes. Itâ€™s particularly robust for
data that violate homogeneity of variance assumptions. Implemented via
\code{\link[rstatix:games_howell_test]{rstatix::games_howell_test()}}.
\item \code{"wilcoxon_test"} - Performs the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (also known as the
Mann-Whitney U test) for non-parametric pairwise comparisons. Useful when
data are not normally distributed. Implemented via
\code{\link[rstatix:wilcox_test]{rstatix::pairwise_wilcox_test()}}.

\examples{
## Example: Creating a raincloud plot for the ToothGrowth dataset.
## This plot visualizes the distribution of the `len` variable by
## `dose` (using different colors) and facets by `supp`. Group
## differences by `dose` are calculated using a `t_test`, and standardized
## mean differences (SMDs) are displayed through jittered points.
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

p <- raincloud(ToothGrowth, len, dose, supp,
  significance = "t_test",
  jitter = 0.15, alpha = 0.4
)

## As `p` is a valid `ggplot` object, we can manipulate its
## characteristics usingthe `ggplot2` or `ggpubr` packages
## to create publication grade plot:
p <- p +
  theme_classic2() +
  theme(
    axis.line.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
  ) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend("Dose [mg]")) +
  ylab("Length [cm]")
